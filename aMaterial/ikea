I went to Ikea with my wife last weekend. 
That's Swedish for Impending Divorce (They should have a divore layer right between bedding and bathroom)
The key to assembling anything as a couple is distance. 
Get as much between you as possible.
I put together the stuff myself I was proud
Only screwed it up twice and only cost me 50 bucks at Home Depot to make it so that she wouldn't notice.

I like to think of Home Depot as people who've graduated from the Ikea book
I'm able to read real instructions instead of follow some fat guy and a spatial reasoning puzzle.

I hate that they only give you an allen wrench to assemble the stuff with.
Did they have a meeting to decide what kind of wrench?
James Socket "It's 1 you sell them and then just give them the sockets they'll need for the furnitur"
Martin Monkey "I'll give you 1 adjustable wrench, work on all sides of bolts but it'll get caught on everything"
Then came Allen "I'm just gonna give them a piece of metal with a bendy bit at the end, they'll leave it on the ground somewhere and never find it till it's caught in their vaccuum a week later."
