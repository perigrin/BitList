Bartending was horrible for my love life, behind the bar was like a friendzone wall.
It sucked balls, and not in the good way.
I'd have cute girls drowning their guy problems in the cheapest wine we have complaining the entire time. 
"I should break up with him" "I can't find a nice guy" "Why is your wine so expensive"
1. Don't make life choices like breaking up with someone when your tongue is purple
2. You're probably not gonna meet the love of your life at a shit the shit hole club that has 'Better wine than here' 
How many time have you been to wedding where you heard the words "When he slammed that shot of jager and told me my ass was slamming I knew it was either the five shots of fireball or forever love"
I'm just looking for a guy who's smart and funny
No you're looking for a guy with a big wallet and dick
"Ok mark what do you want in a girl?"
I just want to dance with somebody I want to feel the heat with somebody
"Why do you do that you always bring up 80's female pop singers when I complain about my love life."
I don't know the right answer but the wrong one was because love is a battlefield
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY I've got a problem I need your help with
Ok sheessh hit me with your best shot.
She smacked me
I did finally figure out how to get one girl to stop complaining, we got married so now I'm the problem.
