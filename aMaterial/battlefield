Bartending was horrible for my love life, behind the bar was like a friendzone wall.

It sucked balls, and not in the good way.

I'd have cute girls drowning their guy problems in the cheapest wine we have tipping even cheaper and complaining the entire time. 

"I should break up with him" "I can't find a nice guy""Why is you wine so expensive" 
1. Don't make life choices like breaking up with someone when your tongue is purple
2. You're not gonna meet the man of your dreams at a shit hole dance club that makes their drinks so much stronger

How many time have you been to wedding where you heard the words 
"When he slammed that shot of jager and told me my ass was slamming I knew it wasn't just the five shots of fireball it was forever love"

I'm just looking for a guy who's smart and funny
No you're looking for a guy with big dick and wallet to match

"Ok mark what do you want in a girl?"
I just want to dance with somebody I want to feel the heat with somebody
"Why do you do that you always bring up 80's female pop singers when I complain about my love life."
I don't know the right answer but the wrong one was because love is a battlefield
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY I've got a problem I need your help with
Ok sheessh hit me with your best shot.
She smacked me
I did finally figure out how to get one girl to stop complaining, we got married so now I'm the problem.
