I'm warming this horse up, you're supposed to hold it on a leash and stand in a certain place in relation to the horse and shoo it with a whip, the horse runs around you and you can see him move and exercise a bit, The fucker kept angling himself so I was out of position, next thing I know I'm running around the horse and He's looking at me like "nice exercise dumbass"
I've been outsmarted by a horse...
