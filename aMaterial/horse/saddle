My wife is a horse girl, she's got her own horse, god I wish she was into cocaine it'd be so much cheaper. 

I don't get horse back riding in general, you take an animal that has easily a thousand pounds on you put a decorative belt made out of it's cousins and kick it in the side around a ring and call it a sport. It makes no sense.
