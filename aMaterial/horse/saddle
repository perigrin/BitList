My wife is a horse girl, she's got her own horse, god I wish she was into cocaine it'd be so much cheaper. 

Horse back riding confuses me in general, You take an animal that literally a half ton of weight on you, strap the a belt made out of one of it's cousins around it's waist then hop on it, then you kick it for an hour and call it a workout. 

I learned how to ride, it's more complicated than strapping up and heading out, you have to warm up the horse. Which entails leasing it like a dog and having it run around you for a while. I leash up the horse and start asking it to move around me, "No no you have to be diagnolly behind it" Ok I move behind it, the horse moves, I move back behind it. After an hour of me circling the horse I was worn out and he thought he did a good job of warming me up.
