Apparently there is a special way to duck on horseback, you hug their neck and lean your entire body up, I did not know this, I'm in some underbrush, they yell duck I lean forward and the branch comes right into my chest, I'm falling over the back of the sadddle, horse keeps going I'm hanging onto said branch like a cat hanigngin on till the weekend.
