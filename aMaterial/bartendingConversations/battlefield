Bartending was horrible for my dating life, I found the behind the bar was the friend zone, it sucked nuts, and not in the good way.
Girls would constantly complain about not being able to find anyone, "Well maybe you shoudn't hang out in shitty clubs and bars, how many weddings have you been to where they say 'I don't know if it was the five shots of fireball or the fact he said I just fell from heaven but I knew it was forever love.' 
"I'm just looking for a guy who's funny and smart" "You want someone with a good dick and money lets be honest." "well what do you want in a girl?"
"I just want to dance with somebody I just want to feel the heat with somebody"
'Why do you do that? you always bring up 80's female pop singers when i'm trying to be serious about love?"
I can't tell you the right answer to this day but I can say the worst answer was apparently Because Love is a battlefield.
"Fuck you take this seriously"
"Ok sheesh, hit me with your best shot"
she smacked me.
I did figure out how to stop her from complaining about her relationship problems to me. We got married NOW I"M THE PROBLEM.
