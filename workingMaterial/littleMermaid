It's weird to go back and look at things as an adult in a different time. I was watching the little mermaid with my wife recently, we got to that part where they're in the lagoon and sebastian is singing. "You've got to kiss the girl" Woah there crab she's never consented to any of this. She's just sitting in the boat, hold strong Eric you don't know this beach girl, Don't listen to the rape crab. Don't even get me started on Sleeping Beauty that's not a fairy tale for girls as much as a frat house.
