It's weird to say Honky no one's really sure what it means, is it a white red neck

You don't hear about the no irish, the wops, or anyhting like that anymore. after a while they're just white.

I mean my family are a bunch of hillbilly brair hoppping folks, I've got family who's on the same line as the duck dynasty people but I'm just White. It's sad.
