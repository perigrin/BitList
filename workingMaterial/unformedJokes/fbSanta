I don't like snopes.com
that website that fact checks internet pranks
whenver i'm scrolling down facebook and I see a friend posting about some dumb thing that they should easily know better
Then you read the comments, 
I can't beleive this is real,
How could someone do this?
No one is this deranged
I see all that emotion in their posts 
Then you do the 3 seconds of googling find the snopes article pop that in the comments
and the entire thing goes dead
it's like telling a 4 year old that santa is fake news 
you kind of expect the disbelief and crying to their parents is on the other end of the computer.
