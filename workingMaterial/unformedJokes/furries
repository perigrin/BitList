I used to work in bar that was the final spot for a furries meetup. If you dont' know furries are those people who dress up as character you'd see at disne or other theme parks. They used to just come in and be a group of socially awkward people hanging out by the pool table till my manager rather drunk asked them why they never came dressed up. Now it's socially awkward foxes hanging out by the pool table. One thing I've learned foxes don't fucking tip for shit.
