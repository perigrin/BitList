I hate gymnastics, ok. I hate watching gymnastics
jailbait girls, and ambigiously gay men throw themselves at perfectly good objects and then get judged.

Actually I hate any sport you have to throw your body around.
Rock climbing. I started rock climbing {Wife asked when I was going up, and then mentioned maybe chipendales was the better way to go} 
my 200 pound ass is huffing and puffing on the easy routes
while some child the size of those midget gymnasts is saying "I can do it why can't the fat man" 
It's things like this that made man invent the tunnel. Some fat guy looked at a mountian "fuck that we'll go through it"
