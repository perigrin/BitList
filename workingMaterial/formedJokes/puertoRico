I saw a delta land in a hurricane. Anyone see that article? A delta pilot landed in between the bands of hurricane Irma load up passengers from San Juan Puerto Rico and take off in between the bands again and make it to JFK airport. That's some freaking dedication. I was really happy to see Delta put that much dedication into helping Puerto Ricans get home safely from San Juan back to whichever burough in New York they live in.
