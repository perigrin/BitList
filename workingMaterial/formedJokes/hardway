My mom was a programmer, my brother followed suit. 
Being from a household of older omputer users you get told to do it the right way.
"But I want to use dream weaver"
"In my day we didn't have dream weaver, we had punch cards, walked ten feet to feed them in and ten feet back to see if it worked"
"I had to hand write my websites with just a bare editor and my vision of how it should be"

"Ok this is the worst when i was your age speech..."
