I never want to move to duckberg.

Life is like a hurricane there in duckberg.
I grew up in florida NOPE done with that.

plus half the population doesn't wear pants.
I don't think I could get used to that.
Do the dry cleaners have to adveritise "Yes we know what pants are"

The city taxes have to be huge
ducks shit every 15 minutes
the streets aren't flooded with shit so someone's gotta be paid for that.
