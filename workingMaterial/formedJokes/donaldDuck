I've got respect for Donald Duck.

He's his own hype man in the Micky Mouse Club song.
Everyone else is "Micky Mouse" and he's the lone guy saying "DONALD DUCK" that takes some hutzpah

Every year one of the most popular write in votes for President is Mickey Mouse, in 2012 he narrowly lost the vote count to Jesus in Travis County Texas. 
Donald deserves those votes. 
When duty called Mickey stayed here, It was Donald who was drafted. Donald stepped up for the nation and is a war hero. 

Everyone knows the term Donald Ducking it?
He never wears pants. Just a shirt and walks around with everything hanging out. 
He started a trend. Look at the entire duck family. Huey Dewey Louie Uncle Scrooge, none of them wasted money on pants.
Makes you wonder in duckberg if they have to advertise that they know what pants are?

Duckberg itself has to be a horrible with taxes. Look at the streets.
Ducks poop every 15 minutes give or take.
 That means walking around called duckberg you have an entire city of non-pants wearing constantly pooping citizens. 
The streets should be covered in poop. 
I bet that's how Scrooge got his money, a poop cleaning service for the area.  

You have to respect Daisy, Donald's girlfriend. 
They've been dating for 40 years, aren't married and deals with all his character flaws.
add that to the fact that ducks have corckscrew dicks and actively rape to reproduce, and you understand why they each of have nephews and neices but no kids.
