o I do open source comedy. I keep it all in GitHub. When I pushed the first branch, I got a PR, but I really thing it was more of a critique. It was just `rm -rf *`. [pause for laugh] And to keep modern I’ve been dockerizing my jokes [slight pause]. I throw each bit into it’s own container, but either I didn’t get the networking layer configured right or I’m just not funny. [pause] I’m leaning towards the latter. [slight pause] But talking it over with people I shouldn’t be self deprecating like that with docker. It can smell the weakness and will take advantage of it.[pause for laugh]”
