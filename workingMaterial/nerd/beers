So I was a bartender, and I usually helped people pick out a good beer to drink. I think programmers could use some help here, you might say it's an untapped market. Python programmers obviously need some Witte space. And you know that Larry Wall enjoys a good Perl 5 Porter. Ruby programmers are a quandary, do you go with an Irish Red or a Kirin Lager? Everyone knows though that sysadmins ... they get Root beer. Well these days with systemd and all they get sudo-beer, that's everclear with a A&W chaser.
