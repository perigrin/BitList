tried talking to a woman at the bar, automatically thought I was hitting on her, explained I'm not interested, now I'm an ugly man hitting on her, I explained I'm married, now I'm an ugly adulterer hitting on her, I tried to explain that I'm just wanting to talk to her about beer, Now I'm an mysoginistic adultuer who wants to get into her pants. I don't talk to women at bars anymore.
