With all the stupidity with traffic here in Houston I'm about to start a charity. We're gonna have a parade down Montrose to raise awareness about traffic Congestions. Just gonna be one guy with a radio flyer wagon waving a flag walking slowly down a 4 mile stretch of the road at 5 o clock. I garuntee everyone in Houston will know about Traffic Congestion.
