The weirest part is here in houston you get into a wreck and every tow truck in the tri county area comes to check it out. How the hell does inviting an Orgy of tow trucks help clear up the accident any quciker? Then I guess the bid on your business, If they're gonna bid I want a fucking auctioneer also supplied. Get me the rate I really want "50 bucks and I'll make sure I only go up to the knuckle on the ride to drop off the car"
