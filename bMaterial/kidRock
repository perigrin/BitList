I'm against Trump but not for the reason most people are.

I don't like having a celebrity president I think it sets a bad example. 
I don't want other celebrities getting into poitics

Imagine Kid Rock being elected to the senate.
"The senator from Michigan has the floor"
"My name is kiiiiii"
"sigh another filibuster..."
