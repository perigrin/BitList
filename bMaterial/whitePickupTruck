One of the first nights I moved into my neighborhood I ordered Papa Johns the driver calls me cause the address numbers are hard to see "How do I find your house?" "Well it's got a white pick up truck in the drive way" and I hung up... I called her back "i'm sorry i forgot what state I live in, knowing my neighborhood here I'm gonna step outside just look for the only white honky in the front yard."
