One of the first nights I moved into my neighborhood I ordered Papa Johns the driver calls me cause the address numbers are hard to see "How do I find your house?" "Well it's got a white pick up truck in the drive way" and I hung up... I called her back "i'm sorry i forgot what state I live in, knowing my neighborhood here I'm gonna step outside just look for the only white honky in the front yard."


I wish I had known more about Houston before I moved out here. I was working on starting up my new job out here and left it ot my wife to find us a place to live etc. So she found a place just north of greenspoint. I didn't know about the place till my first night here. I'm driving in and unloading my pick up's worth of stuff and order myself a pizza, we're in a working class neighborhood, basically just far enough away from greenspoint that you turn the rap music backup if your white, Delivery guy calls asks me which one is my house he can't see the address signs. I say the one with the white pick up tuck. Immediatley call him back realizing there are pick up trucks in every house cause this is texas. "Here I'm gonna step outside I've seen my neighbors I'm gonna be the only honkey in the nieghborhood just deliver the pizza to that guy"
