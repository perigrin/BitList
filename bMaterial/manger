Do you think the In manager charged Joseph and mary for the manger?

Imagine being on of the other guests. "it used to just smell like manger out back now my room smells like barn and frankencense. WHO THE HELL ARE THOSE PEOPLE.. IS THAT A DRUMMER BOY? JESUS CHRIST I"M TRYING TO SLEEP"

"mary I've got a name for this kid now"
