Being from Orlando you're indoctrinated to love all things Disney and worship Chairman Mouse, but I think the programming is starting to break down.

I noticed the other night watching the little mermaid, they were at that classic point floating in the blue lagoon. Sebastian whispers to Eric "boy you'd better do it soon / no time will be better". That's a bit rapey. Ariel can't consent. (Did Sebastian graduate from Penn State?) And I don't care if she can sing, she's got crabs.

Even the Prince Phillip Defense of "I had to kiss her so she'd wake up" ... still rape man.

Don't get me started on that bigamist Charming and the sister-wives Cinderella and Snow White either.
