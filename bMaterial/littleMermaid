Being from Orlando you're indoctrinated to love all things Disney and worship Chairman Mouse

Watching the little mermaid they were at the classic point
Floating in the blue lagoon and Sebastian is whispering to Eric to just kiss the girl
That's a bit rapey, Ariel can't consent.
I don't care if it can sing she still has crabs.

You can't use the Prince Phillip Defense of "I had to kiss her so she'd wake up" it's rape man.

Don't be a bigomist like Prince Charming with Cinderella and Snow White either.
