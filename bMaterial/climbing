My wife suggested we start rock climbing, becasue we're affluent and white and that's what you do...
It's rough to see 6 year olds climb it like a mountain goat and I'm huffing and screaming like a Yetti screaming to get off my lawn. 
This is how the tunnel was invented, some fat guy looked at his friends climbing a mountain and said Nah I'll go through it.
