So I'm apparently not a very good comic, am don't online date, I don't have a rampant drug problem, and I am gainfully employed, but this is something I've always wanted to do ever since I was small, when they asked what do you want to be when you grow up I said either a stand up comedian or a chipendales dancer. so you're welcome. There is something I've always wanted to try "How are you all doing tonight?" ... How the fuck is that an answer? I can't go into the doctor "Mr. Prather how are you doing?" "WOO" "Oh it looks like you're ready to rock" "WOOOO" "You have kidney stones"
