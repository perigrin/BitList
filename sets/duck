I don't want to move to duckberg.

"Life is like a hurricane"
I grew up in Florida, Nope, Done with that.

At least half the population doesn't wear pants
You can't take anyone who Donald Ducking it seriously.
Do the dry cleaners have to advertise they know what pants are.

The municiple taxes have to be huge.
Ducks shit every 15 minutes, but the streets aren't flooded with shit.
The city has to pay someone to clean that up.




I've got respect for Donald Duck though
gets the short end of the stick everytime

He is the lone Donald Duck Supporter in the Micky Mouse Club
Even Chuck D had Flavor Flav to be his hype man Donald does it all.

Donlad is a war hero, drafted into the navy in WW2. 
When duty called he went but Mickey stayed home.

He's also had an ongoing relationship with Daisy for 40 years but isn't married
I got trapped after 12.

Plus ducks have corkscrew dicks and have to rape to procreate because it's so painful for the female.
So I can understand why Daisy and Donald only have Nephews and Neices but no kids.
