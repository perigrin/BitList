Bartending was horrible for my love life, the bar was the fucking friendzone wall. [pantomime]

It sucked balls, and not in the good way.

I'd have cute girls drowning their guy problems in the cheapest wine we have and complaining the entire time. 

"I should break up with him" "I can't find a nice guy" "Why is your wine so expensive" 

1. Don't make life choices when your tongue is purple
2. You're not gonna meet the man of your dreams at that shit hole dance club that makes their "moscato" so much stronger

How many time have you been to wedding where you heard the words 
"When he slammed that jager-bomb and slapped my ass I knew it wasn't just the five shots of fireball it was forever love"

"I'm just looking for a guy who's smart and funny"

No you're looking for a guy whose dick drives its own astin martin. "The name is Schlong, Dick Schlong."

"Ok Mark, what do you want in a girl?"
I just want to dance with somebody I want to feel the heat with somebody
"Why do you do that? You always bring up 80's female pop singers when I complain about my love life."
I don't know the right answer but the wrong one was "because love is a battlefield"
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY I've got a problem I need your help with
Ok hun, hit me with your best shot.
She smacked me
I did finally figure out how to get the girl to stop complaining, we got married so now I'm the problem.
