I know what you're all thinking
"Not another generic white guy"
I'm like the kirkland farms of white, CostCo brand average white guy.
Gotta be a bitch for sketch artists
"He was average height, brown hair, 
He was white so you're not gonna arrest him can we move on"


I don't fit in with my neighbors. 
I live in greenspoint,
I'm not trying to tell racist jokes, 
I order my coffee with cream and sugar so that I don't have to say black in public.
And I don't drink coffee. 

I saw graffitti on the mailboxes that said Blood killa 
and I wondered leukemia?

This is nice though being up here,
I've always wanted to do stand up
first grade they asked what do you want to be?
Stand up comedian, or chipendales dancer
So you're welcome.

something i've awlays wanted to try. 
How you all doing tonight
How is woo an answer? 
I can't go to the doctor
How are you today Mr.Prather?
WOOO
I see you're ready to rock
WOOO
No I mean you have kidney stones

Wife asked me if love is what is keeping us together.
"what's love got to do with it?"
OK you need to stop that
what?
Why do you need to bring up 80's female pop singers everytime we talk about our relationship
Because love is a battlefield?
TAKE THIS SERIOUS, Serious question.
Ok hit me with your best shot.
She hit me.

she's been on me recently to get healtheir.
"when you going up at the open mic tonight?"
"That late? Better start working on that chipendales body"

she horse back rides, she's into horses.
I wish it were cocaine it'd be so much cheaper.

She started also rock climbing and taking me with her.
With all the incredibly in shape people there,
I bet thats howt he tunnel was invented.
Fat guy is watching his friends easily climb this rock 
"Fuck it i'm going through"
