I wish I had known more about houston before I moved here. 

My wife and I live in Greenspoint.
There was a reason the rent was cheap.

I went to get the mail someone had tagged it "Blood Killa"
my first thought was Leukemia? We don't really fit in the neighborhood.

I ordered a pizza delivery guy couldn't see adresses "describe the house"
It's got a white pick up truck in front of it. Oh wait everyhouse does this is texas. 
Here I'm gonna step outside give it to the only honky you see.

There are a few differences here in Texas.

I never knew about the Homecoming Mums, 
Oh shit they put targets on the girls for homecoming.
Good for fathers though, She's wearing what? Oh hunting season is about to start.

I didn't know what a kolachi was
It's an old czech word for I should have gotten a donut

I've yet to see a toaster that make Texas Toast.

I went cow tipping for the first time 
It's hard to figure out 20% of your bill before he wakes up
