My wife is into horses I wish she were into cocaine
It'd be so much chepaer

Horse Back Riding is confusing, 
You strap a belt made from it's cousin around an animal that weighs near a ton, 
then jump on top of it and kick it with spurs. 

I took lessons, it just got more confusing.

They had me start with Lunging the horse. 
I put a leash on the horse and stand kind of behind it and make clicking noises and it runs around me.
I stand where I'm supposed to and click like an idiot, and the horse turns.
I reposition and click, the horse turns again.
This repeates until I'm circling the horse holding the leash clicking like an idiot.
The trainer comes over and congratualtes the horse on a good job lunging me. 

There is also a certain way to duck on a horse. 
My wife doesn't let me know this ahead of time.
You hug the horses neck and lay down on it.
I just leaned forward, the branch came right into my chest.
I'm going over the back of the saddle still stuck on the branch
The horse gets me off his back takes two steps and starts grazing
I'm hanging like a cat on a wire
